# fnn
A general-purpose, lightweight feed-forward neural network library for C++

### Features
 - Cross-platform compilation and targeting (x86/ARM)
 - Customizable input, hidden, and output layer sizes
 - Serializing/deserializing trained models, saving/loading, etc.

### Usage
For the **Pong** demo, just run `Run.sh`. This will compile and run `main.cpp` to show an example of this FNN library playing [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) and using reinforcement learning to improve over time. Almost always, `main.cpp` can be modified to fit your use case, and it is a great example to build from.
