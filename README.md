# fnn
A general purpose, lightweight feed-forward neural network library for C++

### Features
 - Fully cross-platform compilation and targeting
 - Customizable input, hidden, and output layers
 - Serializing/deserializing trained models

### Usage
For the **Pong** demo, just run `Run.sh`. This will compile and run `main.cpp` to show an example of this FNN library playing [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong). Almost always, `main.cpp` can be modified to fit your use case, and it is a great example to build from.
